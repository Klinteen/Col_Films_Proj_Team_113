1. During our 24 hours design sprint, I led the UX team in our project research whereby we brainstormed as a team to come up with our research background, problem statement, research objectives, research questions while I came up with the interview questions used in getting more information from our participants. I also came up with the user persona for our college student content creators interested in uploading videos on our platform while @Philemon worked with me on creating user persona for the general users that will be visiting our streaming platform to watch videos. Here's the link to our figma board to show you the research outcome that informed our design process.
